## Dog-Bread-Classifier-Project

### Project Overview

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project in the AI Nanodegree! In this project, I  learned how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.


CNN trained on AWS.

### steps i take to completeing the project:

Step 0: Import Datasets

Step 1: Detect Humans

Step 2: Detect Dogs

Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)

Step 4: Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)

Step 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)

Step 6: Write your Algorithm

Step 7: Test Your Algorithm

And each step details are documented on the notebook.
